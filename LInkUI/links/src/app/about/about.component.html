<h2>How shortener works?</h2>
<p>Random string is created on the server and original url with short equivalent stores in the database.
  When user goes to the short link, server side finds request url in the database if exists and redirects user to original url</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>This project uses JWToken Security for encoding user's password. HMACSHA256 script is used</p>
